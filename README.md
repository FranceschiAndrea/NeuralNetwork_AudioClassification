# NeuralNetwork_AudioClassification

To execute and test the application, download or clone the code and put it in a folder with our dataset in a folder called "5Classes".
The application requires an installed GPU to run and train on our Network.

When corrected executed, by running "main.py" or "kFold_main.py" the application will split the dataset, extract features, train a model over the LSTM network and finally will evaluate the model using the generated testing set by returning some evaluation metrics.
